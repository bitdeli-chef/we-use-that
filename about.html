  <h2 class="question">What is this?</h2>
  <p>We ask startups about their favorite tools for getting things done. We were heavily, ahem, inspired by <a href="http://usesthis.com/about/">The Setup</a>.</p>
  <h2 class="question">Can I submit my startup to be featured?</h2>
  <p>Sure! The easiest thing to do is to send us a <a href="https://github.com/weusethat/we-use-that">pull request</a>.</p>
  <h2 class="question">What's a pull request?</h2>
  <p>You can also email <strong>submissions@weusethat.com</strong>, but a pull request is much easier.</p>
